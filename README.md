Prerequisite libraries: cyclone, zexy, pdlua (only required for state saving) 


To install, simply clone into a folder in your abstraction search path (or add the folder to your search path) 

Usage: simply create a new [reflectorsynth] object and route its outputs to your [dac~] of choice. You might have to wiggle all the sliders and buttons the first time, but after that it should save its state with the patch.
